# SE_DAY4_Software-Project-Management
## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
a)it ensures client satisfaction and maintains trust
b)it helps avoid cost overruns and keeps the project within budget
c)it allows the product to meet market demands and stay competitive
project managers should;
a)define clear goals milestones
b)prioritize tasks
c)monitor progress
d)manage resourceseffectively to avoid bottleknecks
e)address risks early

## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
a)maximizing resources efficiency, keeping the project within the budget,preventing delays,enhancing stakeholder confidence by showing strong financial management
strategies include;
accurate budgeting,regular cost tracking,scope management,risk management,resource optimization

## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
-Agile is flexible and allows changes during the project life cycle while waterfall follows rigid ,sequential process that doesnt accomodate changes after each phase is completed
-Agile delivers work in iteractive cycles while waterfall requires completing one phase fully before moving to the next
-Agile encourages continous customer feedback throughout development ,while waterfall only involves customer input at the start and end of the project

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile is more beneficial in projects that ;have evolving requirements,require frequentclient feedback,involve innovation,need fater delivery of features.
on the other hand waterfall is more beneficial in projects that;have fixed requirements,require strict documentation,have aclear timeline and budget,invove safety critical systems

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
 a)Define clear requirements
 b)Incorporate testing early 
 c)Automated testing
 d)maual testing
 e)Continuous integration
 f)Code reviews
 Importance of maintaining standards include;
 consitency,reduced risks,customer satisfaction,cost efficiency,regulatory compliance,enhanced collaboration,improved project management
 
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
importance ofdefining project scope include;
clear objectives, prevent scope creep, resource allocation,stakeholder engagement,risk managemet
WBS is useful becuase;
it improves clarity and focus, facilitates detailed planning, enhances estimation, aids in resource management,identifies dependencies

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
